# Client

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This installs peer libraries such as `framer-motion` used for card flip animations.
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Ensure you execute these commands inside the `client` directory.
